Block - a section of a document that can be edited according to needs. It is similar to the element as it also can have <p> or <h1> that has to be closed with or without text inside of it.
Declaration - stands for information about what type of the document it is. It goes as <!DOCTYPE html>.
Attribute - constant HTML defined which helps us create more specific elements. For example, element <a> can have "target=_blank" as an atribute which opens the link in a new tab.
Property - values that we can change or set according to our demands and needs. They are not constant as attributes are and they are linked to attributes.

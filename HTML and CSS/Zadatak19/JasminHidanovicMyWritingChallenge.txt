Differences between Zebra, wagon, and horse are their shapes, sizes, and color patterns but most importantly, one of them is not even a living thing. 
Zebra and horse are quite similar in their shape but the main difference is their color pattern as the zebra has stripes made of two colors, black and white.
The horse on the other end usually has one color where most popular colors are: black, white, or brown.
As we mentioned in the first sentence, the wagon is not a living thing but the similarity between the two animals and the wagon is that it can help with the transport of a specific thing. 
Horses are usually ridden, while wagons are usually pulled, pushed, or attached to a bigger machine that carries them.
Zebras are mostly located in Africa while Horses, to my knowledge, can be found all over the world.
Wagons remind me of the old wild west and old classic movies where there were no rules or laws to abide by.
There is an easter egg hidden in one of the pictures and it's located on the left thigh of a zebra.
Very sneaky and clever place to put it but I managed to figure it out.
Good luck trying to trick me next time :)
